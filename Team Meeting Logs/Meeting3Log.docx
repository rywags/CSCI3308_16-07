Meeting 3:
What we did
Fixed Spotify API
When registering, connecting your account to the API works
Preview of songs works, going to website should work
Improved Post UI


Main Focus for next sprint:
Is there an API that could search the song in the website, instead of getting an external link? Should be able to type a song name and have a drop-down
Add the above into a search bar in the post-screen (“Dynamic Search”)
Improve UI
Overall Appearance
Dynamic Search Libraries
Add some spice
Test Cases
Finalize release notes and Post test case
