Meeting 4:

Make sure for every tool you rate it 
1-2 slides for tools, rate how helpful the tools you used were
What approach you used, iterative, waterfall, etc
For challenges, make it as elaborate as possible. 
And how you resolved them
Any difficult features
4-5 minutes for slides, and 4-5 minutes for demo
Donâ€™t focus on login and register, focus on the rest of the features
For presentation:
Add multiple users and posts to show depth of features
Make sure to fully show features and usability of the website
