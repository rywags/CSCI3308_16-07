Soundsphere
Application Description
Our application will be a social media music-sharing website. It will be like if instagram and spotify had a baby.
There will be a feed screen and a profile screen. Users will be able to make posts to the feed. These posts can consist of an album photo or song photo, a soundbite, a song link, a comment, and tags such as genre, style, and sentiment. Anyone who follows you will see your posts on their feed. Users will be able to put things on their profile such as top 3 current songs, playlists, artists, and more. Users can search and find other users and follow them. Users can also make group chats with other users. These chats will be focused on sharing specific music tastes in correspondence to the music taste associated with the group chat. 
Vision Statement
To be the worldâ€™s go-to platform for discovering, and sharing music.
